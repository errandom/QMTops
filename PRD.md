## Design Direction
The public dashboard should feel modern, vibrant, and approachable with sports-themed visual elements and smooth transitions, while the management section should adopt a more classic, business-focused aesthetic with data tables and efficient layouts prioritizing functionality over flair.

## Color Selection
Complementary (opposite colors) - Using energetic orange and cool blue to represent the dynamic nature of sports while maintaining professional credibility.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Blue (oklch(0.45 0.15 250)) - Communicates trust, professionalism, and stability for the management aspects
- **Secondary Colors**: 
  - Energetic Orange (oklch(0.68 0.18 45)) - Represents action and sports energy for CTAs and sport type indicators
  - Neutral Gray (oklch(0.55 0.01 250)) - Supporting color for secondary UI elements
- **Accent Color**: Bright Amber (oklch(0.75 0.15 75)) - Attention-grabbing for important actions like submitting requests and CTAs
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background (White oklch(0.98 0 0)): Dark Blue text (oklch(0.25 0.08 250)) - Ratio 8.2:1 ✓
  - Card (Light Gray oklch(0.96 0.005 250)): Dark Blue text (oklch(0.25 0.08 250)) - Ratio 7.8:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Blue oklch(0.45 0.15 250)): White text (oklch(0.98 0 0)) - Ratio 6.5:1 ✓
  - Secondary (Energetic Orange oklch(0.68 0.18 45)): Dark text (oklch(0.2 0.05 45)) - Ratio 6.1:1 ✓
  - Accent (Bright Amber oklch(0.75 0.15 75)): Dark text (oklch(0.2 0.05 75)) - Ratio 7.2:1 ✓
  - Muted (Light Gray oklch(0.92 0.005 250)): Medium text (oklch(0.45 0.05 250)) - Ratio 4.8:1 ✓

## Font Selection
The typeface should convey modern athleticism with clean geometric forms for the dashboard while maintaining readability for dense data tables in management - Inter provides this versatility with its excellent legibility at all sizes.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**: 
  - H1 (Page Titles): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing (-0.02em)
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter SemiBold/24px/normal letter spacing
  - H3 (Card Titles): Inter Medium/18px/normal letter spacing
  - Body (General Text): Inter Regular/16px/relaxed line height (1.6)
  - Small (Metadata): Inter Regular/14px/normal line height (1.5)
  - Caption (Table Headers): Inter Medium/12px/uppercase/wide letter spacing (0.05em)

## Animations
Animations should emphasize transitions between filtered states and provide satisfying feedback for user actions while remaining subtle enough not to distract from the data-focused management interface.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: 
  - Sport type toggles pulse briefly when selected to reinforce the filter change
  - Schedule items fade in/out smoothly when filters change
  - Request forms slide in from the right to create spatial continuity
  - Management table rows highlight on hover to indicate interactivity
  - Success confirmations use gentle scale-in animations

  - Primary: Filter toggles and request submissions (immediate feedback)
  - Secondary: Schedule updates and data table interactions
  - Tertiary: Hover states and minor UI responses
